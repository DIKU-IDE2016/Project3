	    		Our group had to review <a href="https://rcoor.github.io/IDEassignment2/index.html">group 6.</a> The layout of the page is very simple and could be made visually more understandable, possibly with a tab for each visualization 
	    		</p>
	    		<p>
	    		Bar Plot: The graph goes out of borders, which looks weird and we believe that the X axis is overcrowded with values, thus hard to read the necessary one. A suggestion would be having every 5th year displayed and have only small line indicators for the rest in between. Only Y axis has a label, the X axis is missing one, feels inconsistent.
	    		 Also, when dealing with data in a time series, it is better to use a line plot as this makes it easier to see a trend in the data. Bar plots are better when you want to emphasize each individual year and not what goes on over 100 years. That being said, following the lines of the bar plot, it is easy to see that the temperatures in recent years have been above the average temperature of the years which is an indicator that it is warmer now than before.
	    		</p>	 
	    		<p>
	    		Multiline Plot: There is no line for the X axis just as in the previous graph. Just as stated in the lecture, a multiline plot with more than a few lines is difficult to understand. It does not adequately describe the data.

						<td class="first"><b>Dataset</b></td>

						<p>
						We chose to display directories as a tree visualization, because it is the easiest to understand and directories with files have hierarchical structure.</p>
						<p>We made this dataset ourselves with the help of a small Node.JS script that lists the directories recursively in a JSON format. The script can be found in our GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/DIKU-IDE2016/Project3/blob/master/makeDataset.js">here</a>. It was improved to add extra attributes for each file in order to have information to display in tooltips. 
						</p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="first"><b>Motivation</b></td>
						<td>
						<p>The way how directories are ordered, is actually called "directory tree", it's already in the name. Trees are the best tool to display hierarchical structures, because it has parent and child nodes and each node can have multiple or none children. The root node is the one at the top (in our case - "IDE"). </p>
						<p> We decided to display the second level nodes at the beginning, so that when the page is opened, the only thing would not be just the root node (that could be hard to spot) or all the nodes opened up (that could be confusing if there are many children to each node). By seeing the second level when starting, we have a clear overview of the main structure and what the visualization is about. </p>
						<p>We chose to use magnitude channels in order to make a distinction between what is a directory and what is a file. The darker ones are directories and the lighter ones are files. As for the links between nodes, we went with something visible but very neutral, so it does not stand out over the nodes themselves.</p>
						<p>In order to increase complexity and usefulness a bit, we have added tooltips when moving the mouse over any of the nodes. This tooltip contains more detail about each node. For files it shows its type, path, size and last edited time, but for the directories, it shows the type and path. The background of the tooltip was added (in a neutral color), because otherwise the text was mixing up with the names of files/folders and was difficult to read.</p>

							<ul>
								<li>The background shape of the tooltip could be dynamically resized based on the amount of content inside. </li>
								<li>If we have a large tree structure, it would be great if it opens up nodes outside of our margins, then the whole view would could be shifted with dragging mouse. </li>
							</ul>
							it could move further,

				<h3>Discussion</h3>
				<table class="discussion">
					<tr>
						<td class="first"><b>Dataset</b></td>
						<td>
						<p>
						The dataset for this network visualization was extracted from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_territories_by_land_borders" target="_blank">wikipedia page</a> including list of countries, their total length of land border, their land border neighbours and border length with each of these neighbours. </p>
						<p> 
						</p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="first"><b>Motivation</b></td>
						<td>
						<p>Many people do not know the countries in south America except the large ones like Brazil and Argentina. Our motivation for this visualization was to create a network that would show the countries situated in this region, their sizes compared to each other and their neighbours using connecting edges. </p>
						<p>The size of the country nodes corresponds to the total length if land border that country has. Being an interactive chart, viewers can interact with it by clicking on a country node which results in the view being zoomed on that particular country and highlighting the neighbours for that country by turning the corresponding edges to red colour. In addition, a legend appears on the top right corner of the screen which displays the neighbouring countries to this node in a list view, with each list item being clickable and having the same effect of clicking on the node on the network.
						</p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="first"><b>Improvements</b></td>
						<td>
						<p>The visualisation already includes some interactivity elements (as discussed) that make it very easy to interpret. However, there are several things that can be done in order to improve it even further. Firstly, some weights can be added to the connecting edges to indicate the size of the border between two countries. For instance, the edge connecting Argentina and Chile can show a small tooltip with the number of kilometres the length of border is between these two countries when the cursor is on it. 
						</p>
						<p>
						In addition to the edges, the nodes could have other relevant attributes besides the size that represents total length of land border. For example, the colour of the nodes which are picked randomly at the moment could be chosen to be correspond to the flag of the countries. Or, the nodes can turn into the shape of the country when they are clicked on. In that way the visualization is even easier to read and interpret. </p>
